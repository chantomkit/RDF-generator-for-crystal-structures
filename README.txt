As a mini project under the 2020 physics summer internship
For PBC, it generates periodic boundary condition RDF
For one layer, it generates cluster RDF with one (adjustable) layer of image cells around the center cell
For auto layer, it generates full clutser RDF with auto filled layers around the center cell according to RMAX
